SDLC - software Development Life Cycle
1. Requirement Gathering
2. Analysis
3. Design
4. Development
5. Testing
6. Deployment
7. Maintenance

2 core models = Agile = Incremental + Iterative

4 core values - Agile Manifesto
1. Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools
2. Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation
3. Responding to change over following a plan
4. Working software over documentation

12 Principles
1. Delivery and feedback
2. Collaboration and People
3. Simplicity
4. Self-organizing teams


Scrum is framework used to implement agile
4 parts:
Roles
Ceremonies
Artifacts
Sprints

Roles:
1. Product Owner
	owns the "WHAT"
	maintain product backlog (prioritized list of product features (stories))
	accepts or rejects completed work or will give change requests
2. Scrum Master
	owns the "HOW WE WORK"
	facilitates the ceremonies
	removes blockers
	coaches the team on scrum
	prepares the burn-up / burn-down charts
3. Dev Team
	owns the "HOW TO DEVELOP"
	design, build, test, deploy
	self-organizing
	cross-functional

Ceremonies:
1. Sprint Planning : decide on what to build and how much to build
2. Daily Stand - up (15 min)
3. Spring Review : demo to stakeholders
4. Sprint Retrospective: inspect and adapt

Artifacts:
1. Product Backlog
2. Sprint Plan
3. burn-up / burn-down charts

Sprint: 2 - 4 weeks

Technical User Stories
Ex: 
As a customer 
I want to reset my password
So that I can regain access to my account 

As a developer
I want a JWT - based authentication
So that my APIs are stateless and secure
----------------------------

Given user is registered
When password reset is requested
Then email a reset link
And the link expires in 10 minutes


----------
Product Backlog
Epic 1: User Authentication System

User Stories
1. User Registration
2. Login
3. Logout
4. Password Reset
5. Token refreshing

Login:
1. create the api endpoint
2. input validation
3. password hashing
4. JWT generation
5. Error handling
6. Unit testing

Acceptance Criteria
Given valid credentials
when Login Api is called
Then JWT Token is generated
And Token expires in 1 hour
